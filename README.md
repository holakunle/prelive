                   PICTURE ARCHIVING AND COMMUNICATION

This repository provides a collection of web services designed to complement Orthanc, enhancing its functionality by managing user permissions and enabling secure study sharing. These services integrate seamlessly with Keycloak for robust user authentication and authorization. They generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that can be included in HTTP authorization headers, allowing secure access to resources. The Orthanc authorization plugin validates these headers to ensure only authorized users can access protected studies.
Additionally, the web services are built to work in tandem with Orthanc Explorer 2, providing a cohesive and secure experience for managing medical imaging data.
Tagline: Securely manage and share Orthanc studies with ease.
